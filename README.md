# fuck

Log exactly how many fucks you give

## Installation

```bash
make && sudo make install
```

Note: the default fuckfile location is `~/.fucks`. This can be changed in the source.

## PG Installation

If you are ~~lame~~ working in a space where furious fuck-typing is frowned upon, compile with:

```bash
make pg && sudo make pg_install
```

This will change the executable to `care` instead of `fuck`.
